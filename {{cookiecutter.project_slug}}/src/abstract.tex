\texttt{bayesian\_pyhf} is a Python package that allows for the parallel Bayesian and frequentist evaluation of multi-channel binned statistical models. The Python library \texttt{pyhf} is used to build such models according to the \texttt{HistFactory} framework and already includes many frequentist inference methodologies. The \texttt{pyhf}-built models are then used as data-generating model for Bayesian inference and evaluated with the Python library \texttt{PyMC}. Based on Monte Carlo Chain Methods, \texttt{PyMC} allows for Bayesian modelling and together with the \texttt{arviz} library offers a wide range of Bayesian analysis tools.
